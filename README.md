# algorithms
Dynamic programming, graphs, trees, in C++11 with GoogleTest

Project is in Visual Studio / MSVC with integrated tests. If I get spare time I'll make a cross platform build as well.
In the mean time, if you haven't checked out Visual Studio Community Edition with Resharper C++, you really should.
